# Project 3: Spots

Spots is an interactive social media website and application where users can add and remove photos, like them, and add minor details to their profile.

## Project Description

This project showcases an example of responsive web design. The page will appear differently, depending on the device you view the webpage on. In the mobile app version of Spots, you will see all of the elements condense into a single column without compromising the functionality, depending on the orientation of the screen.

## Layout Description

The CSS uses a combination of grid display and flex display. There are media inquiries to tailor the display for the maximum width of the screen and a webkit property to make sure the default orientation of smaller screens is vertical. Buttons change opacity when hovered over. All photos and avatar images display with a rounded border using the border radius property.
